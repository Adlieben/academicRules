# academicRules

This package was created to facilitate the thesis project conducted by [Adam Maghout](https://www.adammaghout-academic.com/) at the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO). The functions within the package allow users to obtain a passing decision for a student given a set of passing criteria, for example a minimum grade in some subjects.

The package also allows the investigation of a change in passing criteria.
